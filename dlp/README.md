# Google Video PHP Sample Application

## Description

This simple command-line application demonstrates how to invoke Google 
Video Intelligence API from PHP.

## Build and Run
1.  **Enable APIs** - [Enable the Video Intelligence API](
    https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=videointelligence.googleapis.com)
    and create a new project or select an existing project.
2.  **Download The Credentials** - Click "Go to credentials" after enabling the APIs. Click 
    "New Credentials"
    and select "Service Account Key". Create a new service account, use the JSON key type, and
    select "Create". Once downloaded, set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
    to the path of the JSON key that was downloaded.
3.  **Clone the repo** and cd into this directory
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/php-docs-samples
    $ cd php-docs-samples/video
```
4.  **Install dependencies** via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
    Run `php composer.phar install` (if composer is installed locally) or `composer install`
    (if composer is installed globally).
5.  Run `php video.php`. The following commands are available:

    ```
    help   Displays help for a command
    list   Lists commands
    shots  Detect shot changes in video using Google Cloud Video Intelligence API
    ```

    Example:

    ```
    $ php video.php shots gs://cloudmleap/video/next/fox-snatched.mp4
    annotation_results {
        input_uri: "\/cloudmleap\/video\/next\/fox-snatched.mp4"
        shot_annotations {
            start_time_offset: 41729
            end_time_offset: 1000984
        }
        shot_annotations {
            start_time_offset: 1042713
            end_time_offset: 6006032
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
